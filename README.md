# Deep Learning-based Detection of Breast Cancer Findings in Mammography

This repository contains ongoing research focused on localizing breast cancer-related abnormalities in mammograms using deep learning-based object detection techniques. The primary objective is to develop an explainable, high-performance detection pipeline to assist radiologists with early diagnosis and screening support.

## Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women globally. This project explores automated detection of abnormalities in mammograms through computer vision, utilizing multiple deep learning models.
